Localization in icewm currently is done by copying "po/icewm.pot" to a 
file called "po/$LOCALE.pot" (e.g. "po/ba.po", if "ba" is your locale -- 
don't know), filling the stubs (msgstr "") with proper text and finally 
sending back the file to the developers or submitting it the patch 
manager on sourceforge  ---  In the hope no one forgets to put the new 
file into CVS.
